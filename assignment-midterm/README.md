README for Tuan Tang's Midterm

#DESCRIPTION:
renamingMachine.py is a python script that will automatically make a new folder based on the user's input, then copy and rename files to that folder based on the user's provided name and file extension.





#ARGUMENTS:
N/A





#EXAMPLES:
For example, I have a bunch of images in folder "version #1"

When this script is ran, it will prompt the user to input the directory in which their images are in. Then it will prompt the user to choose a new name for their new folder and files. So for this example, I want my new folder to be named "version #2" and my files to be renamed to "v2_#" and I want the file extension to be in "png". The script will then collect all of the files in the "version 1" folder and make a new "version 2" folder then copy all of the files over to that folder and rename them based on out previous inputs. So the files will be renamed "v2_1.png, v2_2.png, v2_3.png..." and so on.
